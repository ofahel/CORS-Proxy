Make simple things to do complex task

As [Steve Jobs][jobs_wiki] says on the [BusinessWeek, May 25 1998][jobs_quote]

> Thatâ€™s been one of my mantras â€” focus and simplicity.
> Simple can be harder than complex:

> But itâ€™s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.
